# MOM-2236's GitHub.io pages

Thanks for checking out my (horrible, horrible) Markdown source code. You'll find all non-page files (including any files I have mirrored) under the `storage` folder. This site isn't using a theme because I couldn't find one that I thought looked nice *and* didn't burn my eyes, so I've just stuck with the standard GitHub Pages theme, even though it's (personally) painful to look at with the white background.

The [Jekyll site](https://mom-2236.github.io/titanfall_research/) in question.
