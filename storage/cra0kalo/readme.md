These files are mirrored from Cra0kalo's website. I didn't code any of these, and I don't claim to have done so. I'm merely providing them here so you don't have to download them through the Internet Archive, or fumble around with URLs if Cra0kalo's website ever starts giving out 404's and 403's on the Titanfall VPK Tool ZIPs again. You're free to link the files here on this page, or just this folder, if for whatever reason Cra0's website has issues or the tool can no longer be downloaded from there directly anymore.

<!--
To be honest though, if it *was* open source, I would have forked it and modified it to do what I need it
to do. I imagine LZHAM's source being a pain to get working in newer versions of VS might be a reason why
Cra0 never released the source to the VPK tool. Either that, or knowing what it could do. Because I too know.

Cra0, if you want these files removed from my repo, let me know, and I'll take them down.

The contents of the archives are unmodified, and they aren't repacked.
