[How to increase the FOV in Titanfall 1](/titanfall_research/fov.html)

A text only guide on how to increase the FOV in Titanfall 1 beyond the original limitations of 70-90 degrees, because enough people have asked me how to do it and I haven't seen a *text* guide so far, but maybe I didn't look very hard.

[FAQ](/titanfall_research/faq.html)

Frequently Asked Questions. Simple enough.

[Recovered Vertical guide from a deleted Facepunch post](/titanfall_research/vertical_titanfall_2_to_source.html) (RIP Facepunch)

Note that the above guide isn't updated for 2020 - there's a lot that has changed between the original writing of that guide, and now, including the update to Legion, which allows you to export textures (sort of) from the Titanfall 2 RPAK files, as well as Legion being able to decompile the MDL files without losing the animations. I won't be editing *this* guide to fix those issues - that should be saved for an entirely new guide which involves free tools (such as Blender) and uses the new methods, as well as not using Intel GPA (which I could not get to hook Titanfall 2). The purpose of this guide being here is for archive purposes only - it is missing from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217012514/https://forum.facepunch.com/f/fbx/bskox/Tutorial-Titanfall-2-to-Source-WARNING-LONG-OP-LOTS-OF-IMAGES/1/).

More pages will be added when what I do has a purpose in being documented and published.
