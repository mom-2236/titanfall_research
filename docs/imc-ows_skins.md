# Interstellar Mining Corporation Off World Security

You can keep up to date with my in-progress on my work in the **TF\| Remnant Fleet [Discord](https://discord.gg/tWt4mBP)** - I post work in progress screens to #modding when I'm working on stuff.

>At one point, Wonyeon only held a license to simply manufacture the R-101 Carbine from Lastimosa Armory, as a second source for the IMC; they stayed out of the Combat Rifle market and focussed on other platforms. They've since used their licence to produce the R-101 platform to test their new, in-house developed 6.19mm PDW bullet, using a projectile not too dissimilar from the G2A4 and D-101 Longbow rifles already on the market — both products of Lastimosa Armory. The C.A.R. boasts an increased fire rate when compared to the R-101C, while competing against the Tungsten 8.19mm round's impact - Lastimosa Armory's round of choice for the R-101C. It ships with a unique set of sights, as Wonyeon has reduced the bulk of the top of the receiver compared to the R-101C — these new sights further blur the line between iron sights and holographics, even further than Lastimosa Armory's original so-called Iron Dot set. The front sight of Wonyeon's new issue still has the signature Iron Dot feel, while the rear sight is more open than the rear sight that has been shipping standard with the R-101C for years.

>Wonyeon Defence's outing into the PDW market has proved popular in CQB trials - it packs a higher fire rate than the R-101C, while maintaining a higher level of accuracy than it's distant cousin — more compact R-97, which also produced by Lastimosa Armory. The tradeoff benefits Pilots who find themselves in plenty of close quarters engagements, but still need to provide fire support at range. Like the R-101C it's based on, it's an all around reliable choice.

>As for the models equipped by the Off World Security — these C.A.R.s features a matte slate finish — they've got minimal markings on the, too, but they still keep that signature Wonyeon C.A.R. styling. These models are provided exclusively to the IMC's Off World Security branch, or at least they were supposed to be. A few thousand units shipped to the OWS for reserves are still unaccounted for, you can guess where they've probably ended up.

This is my first full replacement skin. It was heavily inspired by a lighting error on Colony, and my displeasure with bright shades of white because my eyes are *painfully* sensitive (fact: my own website burns my eyes, and I could not find a good night-mode skin for Jekyll! Checking my own website's layout is painful)

>Lastimosa Armory has licensed the R-101 design out to a number of manufacturers, but the models you'll find out in the Frontier are all manufactured by Lastimosa Armory themselves. The R-101 has proven effective over it's many redesigns, and the R-101C Carbine is no exception. With its compact collapsible stow feature, the R-101C quickly became a must have for the IMC's Grunt and Pilot forces alike.

>The R-101 series was adopted late by the OWS; adoption of earlier models in tandem with the IMC 1st Fleet, among others, was considered non-priority to keep their G2A4 and Hemlok lineup until the R-101C hit trials and proved more effective across the board.
